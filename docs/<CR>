== Overview

gflux is an engine that processes integration flows. These flows may be message driven flows (EIP) or data-driven flows (ETL). The primary characteristic of an integration flow unlike a generic workflow is that they are of short lifetime and interact with parties that are systems (not humans). gflux supports flows that interfact with a variety of communication and transport protocols and involve processing steps such as mapping (payload/data transformation), filtering, routing, split, merge. gflux supports real-time processing of data.

== Flow DSL

The native DSL of gflux is in XML to allow compatibility with a wide variety of tools and libraries. The XML is carefully designed for human consumption and also possesses a schema. The DSL can be extended via custom XML elements.

=== Flow DSL Examples

.file2file.xml
[source,xml]
---
<flow name="SimpleFile2File" description="File to File move on confirmation">
 <file-endpoint id="inboxDir" uri="file://data/inbox" />
 <file-endpoint id="confirmDir" uri="file://data/.done" />
 <file-endpoint id="outboxDir" uri="ftp://data/outbox" />
 <source from-endpoint="orders" idempotent="true" to-route="inflight" confirm-endpoint="confirmDir" />
 <sink from-route="inflight" to-endpoint="outboxDir"  />
</flow>
